/**
 * Called when a subject's current/active contexts are updated.
 *
 * <p>There are no guarantees that this event will be called for every update. It is merely to be
 * used as a "hint" for plugins which depend on the current active contexts for a player.</p>
 *
 * <p>It will always be fired following a call to
 * {@link ContextManager#signalContextUpdate(Object)}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getSubject() subject} is always an instance of the platform's subject type. See
 * {@link ContextManager} for details.</p>
 *
 * <p>Unlike most other LuckPerms events, this event is not fired asynchronously. Care should be
 * taken to ensure listeners are lightweight. Additionally, listeners should ensure they do not
 * cause further updates to player context, thus possibly causing a stack overflow.</p>
