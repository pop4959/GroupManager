/**
 * Calculates the contexts applicable for a contextual subject.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface should satisfy the following
 * requirements:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Context lookups should be <i>fast</i>: lookup methods are likely to
 *     be invoked frequently, and should therefore be fast to execute. If
 *     determining the current contexts involves a particularly time consuming
 *     lookup (database queries, network requests, etc), then such results
 *     should be cached ahead of time.</li>
 *
 *     <li>Context lookups should be <i>thread-safe</i>: lookups will sometimes
 *     be performed from "async" threads, and therefore should not access any
 *     part of the server only safe for access from a sync context. If
 *     necessary, such results should be determined ahead of time and stored in
 *     a thread-safe collection for retrieval later.</li>
 *
 *     <li>Context lookups should <i>not query active contexts</i>: doing so is
 *     likely to result in a stack overflow, or thread deadlock. Care should be
 *     taken to avoid (indirect) calls to the same calculator.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p></p>
 *
 * <p>Calculators should be registered using
 * {@link ContextManager#registerCalculator(ContextCalculator)}.</p>
